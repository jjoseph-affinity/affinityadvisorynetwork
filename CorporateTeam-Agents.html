                        <p>
                            Douglas A. Sanders takes great pride in his work as a post-retirement
                            professional. Drawing on his years coaching college athletes,
                            he understands the power of a team. He brought that same team
                            approach to his work with TransAmerica. He earned his Life license
                            from the State of Ohio and used it to begin providing his clients with
                            the very best insurance options. This work inspired him to seek more
                            team members to help provide his clients with more complete planning,
                            better protections, income, and distributions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, he immersed himself in learning the intricate details of retirement
                            and Estate protection planning, Social Security and Medicare,
                            Long-Term Care options and solutions, and Veterans benefits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Doug began his career at Affinity shadowing the founder and president
                            extensively. During this close-up work, Doug experienced the
                            specialized Estate protection strategies specifically created to achieve
                            the goals of the retired senior. Doug has contributed to the development
                            of highly customized plans and has helped to protect the
                            lifestyle and legacy of Affinity clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the multi-disciplinary network is the foundation of all planning,
                            the proper coordination of each professional is critical. Doug
                            will make sure each professional makes their contribution exactly as
                            necessary to help you achieve your goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Doug has focused his practice on families in Northeast Ohio. He
                            often consults with the CEO of Affinity on customized plans for his
                            clients. So, if your goals are to protect your money and property from
                            Probate and long-term care facilities, create endless income, minimize
                            taxes, or to maximize distributions to your spouse or children,
                            Doug will be the coach that will get you there!
